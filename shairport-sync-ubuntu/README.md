# Shairport Sync

Stream music to your Home Assistant device
via Apple AirPlay. Supports a variety of
customisation options to allow configuring
Shairport to taste.

This add-on is built using the binary packages
provided in Ubuntu "bionic", so it may take
some time to install, depending on the speed
of your device.

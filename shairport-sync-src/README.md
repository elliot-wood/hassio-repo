# Shairport Sync

Stream music to your Home Assistant device
via Apple AirPlay. Supports a variety of
customisation options to allow configuring
Shairport to taste.

This is the Alpine based source version. It is more recent
compared to the Ubuntu version, but requires building
from source, which may take a while on low powered
devices, and could cause considerable wear to your
SD card if you are using a Raspberry Pi or similar.
